# microbit-project
small school project

accompyaning microbit program: https://makecode.microbit.org/_dHUhUaa404t3

some notes: 
- unsure about COM ports, program may refuse to run as its coded for COM3 and this may change
- code is very overcommented, this is because its a school project
- its also a tad bit messy, it was pretty rushed and i'm unfamiliar with serial stuff
